Millennium&rsquo;s prepackaged plan would force Voya to release its claims.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoya holds USD 106.8m of the debt, and had objected to Millennium&rsquo;s plan, which calls for the lenders to get USD 600m in new term loans plus 100% of reorganized Millennium&rsquo;s equity. Voya&rsquo;s primary plan objection, echoed by the US Trustee&rsquo;s office, is that Voya should have the option to opt out of releases being granted to third parties, including the company&rsquo;s directors and officers.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tVoya filed its lawsuit in the US District Court for the District of Delaware on 9 December. Voya said in the suit it has claims for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) and fraud. Voya had said in the bankruptcy court that it planned to assert various fraud claims against certain non-debtor affiliates related to &ldquo;material misrepresentations&rdquo; made to them when the credit facility was issued. Judge Gregory Sleet has granted the lender&rsquo;s motion to file the complaint under seal.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tMillennium had the first part of its confirmation hearing on Thursday (10 December) before Judge Laurie Silverstein of the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. Voya and the US Trustee maintained at that hearing that the plan should not be confirmed with the nonconsensual third party releases. Judge Silverstein said during the hearing that she wanted time to consider the plan after the hearing, and will reconvene this afternoon at 3:30pm to issue her ruling on plan confirmation.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\tThe Debtwire legal analyst team reviewed the lack of clarity on reorganization plans including nonconsensual creditor releases of third parties in<a href=\"http://www.debtwire.com/intelligence/view/1952993\" target=\"_blank\"> this article</a>.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://debtwire.com/dockets/cases/deb-1-15-bk-12284?s=14\" target=\"_blank\">CLICK HERE</a> to view the restructuring plan.<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://us.debtwire.com/deals/openfile.asp?id=3462\" target=\"_blank\">CLICK HERE</a> for the Millennium Health 2019 holdings chart.<br />\r\n\t<br />\r\n\t<a href=\"http://debtwire.com/dockets/cases/deb-1-15-bk-12284\" target=\"_blank\">CLICK HERE</a> to view all <strong>Millennium Health </strong>Chapter 11 filings in <strong>Debtwire Dockets</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tby <a href=\"mailto:patrick.holohan@debtwire.com\" target=\"_blank\">Pat Holohan</a></p>\r\n",
